Emojify ðŸ˜˜
==========

In a given string convert unicode and `:shortcode:` emojis to `<img />` tags using asset packages like [https://joypixels.com](https://joypixels.com).

## Unicode version

Currently supported Unicode version: `15.0`. Minimum supported `emoji-assets` version: `8.0.0`.

## Usage:

This package is a collection of utility functions loosely based on `twemoji` and `joypixels` legacy javascript libraries. It
aims to completely replace those with a modern ES implementation, full unicode spec support and flexible image
collection support. SVG sprites are not supported for performance reasons. For best results pair
with https://github.com/joypixels/emoji-assets.

## Functions:

### isSingleEmoji(string)

Determines if string contains only a single emoji. Automatically trims whitespace before checking. Returns bool.

### shortnamesToUnicode(string)

Takes a string with shortnames and returns a string with every known emoji shortname replaced with corresponding unicode
representation. Ignores unknown shortnames.

### unicodeToShortnames(string)

Opposite of `shortnamesToUnicode`.

### renderShortname(string, options)

Takes a string with shortnames and returns a string with every known emoji shortname replaced with an image tag. Useful
for rendering specific emojis when it's easier to use `:bacon:` instead of ðŸ¥“. For a list of supported options check
below.

### render(string, options)

Takes a string with unicode emojis and returns a string with every known emoji sequence replaced with an image tag.
Useful for rendering user generated content. For a list of supported options check below.

### emojiCollection

An array of objects containing all supported emojis. Format is:

```
{
  category: "people", // emoji category according to spec
  hex: "1f603", // hex representation used to reference images
  shortname: ":smiley:", // shortname representation, legacy so no aliases are supported
  suggest: true // should this emoji appear in suggestions based on current support by major OS versions
}
```

### emojiRegex

String containing regular expression for a single emoji character supported by this library and assets. Usage:

```
const myRegex = new RegExp(emojiRegex); // do stuff
```

### shortnameRegex

Same as `emojiRegex`, but for shortnames.

## Options:

Render functions and some helper functions support these options. This list contains keys and their default values.

```
{
  size: 64, // size of emojis to use when the default CDN is used, supported sizes are: 32, 64, 128
  className: null, // CSS class to use when rendering image tags
  unsafe: false, // when set to true, render will NOT sanitize the string, e.g. it forces "unsafe" output
  single: false, // when the string contains just a single emoji this speeds up render a bit
  cdn: undefined, // CDN to use for image paths
}
```

By default, the path to emoji images is constructed like this: `/images/emojis-v${version}/${size}`. `version` is
the https://github.com/joypixels/emoji-assets version used to generate the emojis.json file and `size` is the asset
size (32/64/128).

Example output: `/images/emojis-v8.0.0/64/1f603.png`. When `cdn` option is specified, it will be used
instead. When just a `size` is specified, default path will be used with `size` being replaced by the one provided in
options.

## TypeScript

Every function described in this readme is fully typed, you shoudn't need any additional type declarations.

## Maintenance

There is a number of internal scripts available to re-generate and update this package from time to time.
You can run these scripts via `node run <script>`

### generate

This will download the current unicode spec file unless cached locally, generate an emoji collection,
compare that collection against assets package and generate new vendor/emojis.json dictionary as
well as new regex for matching. Based on excellent work of Mathias Bynens: [emoji-regex](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex).
His package is not used here because we need to only include emojis currently supported by the
assets package, not every emoji in the spec.

### extract

Extracts current emoji-assets description json and puts it in `.tmp/` folder.

### suggestable

Shows every emoji with suggest: true. Use `inline` flag to have output in one line instead of a list:
`node run suggestable inline`

### spec_test

Tries to render every emoji in current unicode spec and checks for potential errors.

### device_test

Tries to render every emoji located in [scaffolding/emojis_ios.txt](scaffolding/emojis_ios.txt) or
[scaffolding/emojis_android.txt](scaffolding/emojis_android.txt)
and checks for potential errors. By default uses `ios` spec, pass `android` flag to check android emojis:
`node run device_test android`
